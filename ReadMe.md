Why, hello there. 

You appear to have peered behind the curtain and find yourself gazing, perhaps in an admiring but more likely in an admonishing fashion, at the source code for the site otherwise known as johnlaudun.net, but which reveals itself to be entirely made up of files that reside on GitHub. 

If you are not terribly disappointed by this, then what you have in your hands, if the site itself is working -- because, who knows, maybe you arrived here through the internet catacombs and have never seen the GitHub Pages version of the site, is a template for a site you yourself can spend entirely too much time maintaining. (I am definitely not writing from anything like the exhausting well of experience.)

No matter, we do need to get the essential things out of the way, like making it clear that this site, as an infrastructure is **released under MIT License**:
