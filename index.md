# People—Stories—Ideas

I am a researcher focused on exploring how people create worlds in and through  stories based on shared understanding (ideas). I use both qualitative and quantitative methods in my approach to exploring how stories are embedded in everyday discourse and how those stories in turn cascade across socio-cultural networks both online and offline (and across time and space). In over 50 peer-reviewed publications I have examined how ideas are embedded in narrative ([2023](portfolio/publications/Laudun-2023-weathering.pdf)), how narratives are transformed as they pass through networks ([2020](portfolio/publications/laudun-2020-clowns.pdf)), and how narratives and the ideas they contain create social realities ([2012](portfolio/publications/Laudun-2012-rayne.pdf)) as well as economic opportunities ([2016](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-amazing-crawfish-boat-john-laudun/cb503047e6976c80); [first three chapters](portfolio/publications/Laudun-2016-first_3_chapters.pdf)).

In addition to my published work in academic journals and edited volumes (some of which have been translated into Chinese and French), I have been cited or interviewed in newspapers like the _New York Times_, the _L.A. Times_, and _The Philadelphia Inquirer_ as well as public television documentaries and podcasts. I have been a Jacob K. Javits Fellow, a MacArthur Scholar, a fellow at the EVIA Digital Archive, a fellow with the Institute on Network Studies in the Humanities, and a senior researcher at UCLA’s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics. 

I am currently a [professor at UL-Lafayette](ul-profile.md), where I [teach courses](https://johnlaudun.net/teaching/) on folklore, digital culture(s), text analytics, and game studies. I have served as a major advisor to students pursuing PhDs and MAs in folklore studies, literary studies, creative writing, Francophone studies, and architecture.

During a two-year leave of absence in 2020--2022, I was a professor of social informatics with the U.S. Army's TRADOC. I was part of a team that developed a curriculum and a course for senior civilian and military leaders on the role that human information systems play in Information Advantage (IA) and Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). I also helped revise ADP 3-13 _Information_.
