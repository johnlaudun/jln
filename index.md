# People – Stories – Networks

**Hello there!** All the usual portfolio things are here: projects, statements, vita as well as links to other things, like courses I teach. For those interested, I am now blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnlaudun) and microblogging on [Mastodon](https://hcommons.social/@johnlaudun). Almost everything else should be here, or will be shortly. Drop me a note in the fediverse if there's something here you want.

## Latest Updates

**Fall 2024 Courses**: Course descriptions for Fall 2024 are in and have been [logged](https://johnlaudun.net/2024/02/28/courses-fall-2024.html).

**Digital Folklore Podcast Interview**: I was interview by Perry Carpenter and Mason Amadeus of the *Digital Folklore* podcast and it was a blast! We had a wide-ranging conversation and they ended up pairing me with Lev Gorelov for their episode on ["Statistically Conscious (Artificial Intelligence)"](https://digitalfolklore.fm/episodes/s2e6).

**Data Sources Updated**: If you've asked about sources for cultural data, that [list](guides/data.html) has been updated.
