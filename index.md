# People – Texts – Networks

**Hello there!** All the usual portfolio things are here: projects, statements, vita as well as links to other things, like courses I teach. For those interested, I am now blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnlaudun) and microblogging on [Mastodon](https://hcommons.social/@johnlaudun). Almost everything else should be here, or will be shortly. Drop me a note in the fediverse if there's something here you want.
