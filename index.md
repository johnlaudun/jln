# People – Texts – Networks

**Hello there!** All the usual portfolio things are here: projects, statements, vita as well as links to other things, like courses I teach. For those interested, I am now blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnlaudun) and microblogging on [Mastodon](https://hcommons.social/@johnlaudun). Almost everything else should be here, or will be shortly. Drop me a note in the fediverse if there's something here you want.

## Current Projects

Katie Kinnaird, Allison Chaney, and I recently (finally) submitted the latest iteration of our work with TED talks: "Speaking Subjects, Subjects Spoken: Using TED Talks to Understand Discursive Gender Formations." I've posted the [introduction]({% post_url 2023-12-11-TED-talks-gender %}) in the logbook.
