# People—Stories—Ideas

I am a researcher focused on exploring how people create worlds through ideas embedded in stories. All of us live, work, and play in multiple groups. We carry ideas from one group to another, and those ideas transit through us, sometimes circumnavigating the world in the process. Understanding this process is at the heart of **narrative intelligence**. 

# Updates

For those interested, I am now blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@johnlaudun) and microblogging on [Mastodon](https://hcommons.social/@johnlaudun). Almost everything else should be here, or will be shortly. Drop me a note in the fediverse if there's something here you want.

Spring 2024’s [Introduction to Text Analytics](https://johnlaudun.net/teaching/courses/370-ta/) was the first of its kind at UL-Lafayette. Next up is the first course on [Narrative Games](https://johnlaudun.net/teaching/courses/370-games/) in Fall 2024. (See this [log entry](https://johnlaudun.net/2024/02/28/courses-fall-2024.html) for more.)

**Digital Folklore Podcast Interview**: I was interviewed by Perry Carpenter and Mason Amadeus of the *Digital Folklore* podcast and it was a blast! We had a wide-ranging conversation and they ended up pairing me with Lev Gorelov for their episode on ["Statistically Conscious (Artificial Intelligence)"](https://digitalfolklore.fm/episodes/s2e6).

**Data Sources Updated**: If you've asked about sources for cultural data, that [list](guides/data.html) has been updated.
