### Noteworthy

John Laudun received his MA in literary studies from Syracuse University in 1989 and his PhD in folklore studies from the Folklore Institute at Indiana University in 1999. He was a Jacob K. Javits Fellow while at Syracuse and Indiana (1987-1992), and a MacArthur Scholar at the Indiana Center for Global Change and World Peace (1993-94). He has written grants that have been funded by the Grammy Foundation and the Louisiana Board of Regents, been a fellow with the EVIA Digital Archive and a scholar in residence with UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics. His book, *The Amazing Crawfish Boat*, is a longitudinal ethnographic study of creativity and tradition within a material folk culture domain.

### Current Research

Laudun's current work is in the realm of culture analytics. He is currently engaged in several collaborations with physicists and other scientists seeking to understand how texts can be modeled computationally in order to better describe functions and features.

### Acknowledgements

UL Lafayette markets itself on its warm and welcoming community. This community must be for all and be for justice. In 1954, UL (then Southwestern Louisiana Institute) was the first university in the south to desegregate. This is justifiably a point of pride for the University, but we have rested too long on this laurel: close to seventy years later, we still have a great deal of work to do in fighting the legacy of racism on our campus. We in the English Department commit to the path of decolonization, anti-racism, and reparation. We call upon the University to recognize the urgency of this commitment and to act swiftly in the interest of justice.
