If you're in need of free to use, and possibly free to adapt -- what the legal types call *derive* -- images and possibly audio, there are two places you should definitely bookmark:

* [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/search/?c=150&fa=online-format:image&q=monopolist&st=list)
* [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/OpenAccess) encourages downloading, sharing, and reuse of its millions of 4.4 million 2D and 3D digital items from their collections, with the promise of more to come. This includes images and data from across the Smithsonianâ€™s 19 museums, nine research centers, libraries, archives, and the National Zoo. They note there's no need to ask for permission.

* Welcome Library: http: //wellcomeimages.org/. Public domain, free to use: amazing range of subject matter beyond medicine and science.
