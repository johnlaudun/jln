title: Install Briss with Homebrew

---

If like me you found yourself in need of the PDF-cropping abilities of Briss, but have faced the wall that is Java on Apple Silicon, fear not. [Homebrew][] has your back. For those not familiar with Home-brew, it is a package manager, much like the venerable [MacPorts][] -- which I used for years to manage my installation of Python before switching to Mini Conda. All three are package managers which make it easy to install a variety of shell programs and Python, and other scripting language, libraries on your computer. All three work on a Mac. Home-brew also works on Linux, and Miniconda, like its larger sibling [Anaconda][], works on all three current OS platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows.
