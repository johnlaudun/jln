A little over a year ago [Cory Doctorow echoed][cd] out to a larger audience a report by _[Nature][]_ on Carl Malamud's development of "a full-text-searchable index of 100,000,000 scientific articles." The catalog contains 355 billion words, and returns five-word snippets and citations in response to queries. It's publicly available for all to mine and search.

The index itself is at [The Internet Archive][ia].
