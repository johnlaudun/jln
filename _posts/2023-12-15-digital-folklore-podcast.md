I was interviewed by Perry Carpenter and Mason Amadeus of the *Digital Folklore* podcast and it was a blast! We had a wide-ranging conversation and they ended up pairing me with Lev Gorelov for their episode on ["Statistically Conscious (Artificial Intelligence)"](https://digitalfolklore.fm/episodes/s2e6).
