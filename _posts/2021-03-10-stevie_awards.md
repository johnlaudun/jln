The [Stevie Awards](https://blog.stevieawards.com/2021-stevie-awards-webinars) are, according to their website, "the world's premier business awards ... created in 2002 to honor and generate public recognition of the achievements and positive contributions of organizations and working professionals worldwide."

Of course I am curious, but I also wonder where the boundary for an interest in narrative lies? Thereâ€™s a good research project, perhaps a dissertation, lying there for someone to pursue: all the ways the business world uses *stories*, *storytelling*, and *narrative*. I once did a survey of how *culture* is used in the business literature, but that was a while ago.
