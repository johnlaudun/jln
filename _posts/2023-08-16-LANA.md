My thanks again to the organizers of this year’s Louisiana Aging Network Association conference for the invitation to spend time with all of you. For those interested in materials from my talk, “Listening for the Past: Learning to Listen for How History Actually Gets Told” the links are below:

- The talk itself is now available on [Medium](https://johnlaudun.medium.com/listening-for-lives-d7bec88e1e89). The texts are block quotes, and the takeaways are embedded in the text as slide images. 
- The slides are available for download from my [portfolio](https://github.com/johnlaudun/portfolio/blob/master/presentations/2023-LANA.pdf). 

Many thanks again for letting me spend time with you and for the amazing questions and conversations that followed.
