If like me you read a lot of manuscripts in Word and then meet with manuscript authors to discuss their work and if like me you prefer to make compelling, constructive comments, then you are left flipping, or scrolling through a manuscript to remind yourself of your comments. To do that, you might want to be able to print those comments. Here’s how to do it:

1. While in the Word document for which you wish to see comments, go to print the document. 

2. In the **Print** dialog box, go to the **Microsoft Word** option — you may have to click the **>** next to it to unfold it. 

3. Click on the dropdown menu next to **Print What:** and select **List of markup**.

Click **Print** and it will print your comments as well as, sadly, all the changes you’ve made. I tend not to make a lot of editorial changes in a document but, rather, focus on higher-level matters in hopes that, as the topical and methodological kinks get worked out, so too will the grammatical ones.
