In a response to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKyEDfnDAWM) by Parker Settecase on the utility of boredom and of capitalizing on it by using a notebook, [theorangecatmom ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR2TD0htM8fskASWpkybvFw) noted: 

> I'm not that smart, but my Dad taught me to use my brain to entertain myself when bored pre-cellphones. I still make myself practice it when I'm in a waiting room or sometimes on my breaks at work. As a kid, he taught me to count things, find patterns in the stuff around me, play mental math games, stuff like that. As an adult, when I'm surrounded by people, I sometimes just listen or watch what they're doing and think about why they might be doing it. I call it practicing being bored and it blows people's minds that I do it on purpose.
