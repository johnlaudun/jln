title: Remembering Lévi-Strauss
layout: post

As structuralism / grand theory re-emerges in the context of the humanities, I remembered that years ago I had compiled a small reader focused on Lévi-Strauss. I have scanned the items below to (OCRed) PDF if anyone is interested any of the individual pieces or the group as a whole. (I would link directly to the PDF[s], but these items are still under copyright, and I want to keep to fair use.)
