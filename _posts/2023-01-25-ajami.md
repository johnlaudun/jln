A friend of mine pointed me to reporting by _[Futurity](https://www.futurity.org/ajami-script-2859702-2/)_ on the discovery of *Ajami*, a form of Arabic script modified to capture local spoken languages in Africa. It has apparently been in use for quite some time, and undermines claims by colonial operatives that natives were illiterate. Far from it, as it turns out! Across West Africa people had taken the Arabic script that came with the spread of Islam and used it to capture the sounds of the languages they spoke, thus making it possible to record a variety of information. Even better: it appears that the effort to document *Ajami* has been [institutionalized](https://sites.bu.edu/nehajami/). (My training in linguistics is largely autodidact, so I don't know what the technical term is for this. A kind of *creole* perhaps? At the very least a *hybrid written language*?
