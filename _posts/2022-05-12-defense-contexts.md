There are a lot more sources than these, but these are the ones I consistently consider in order to keep up with the (textual) context within which the Army operates.

## Serious Security Publications

- [War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/) bills itself as the "producer of essays and podcasts by experts and/or with deep experience in foreign policy and national security issues." 
- Its sister publication, the [Texas National Security Review](https://tnsr.org/),  is more scholarly in nature.
- [The Strategy Bridge](https://thestrategybridge.org/), like WotR, is both a journal, a podcast, as well as a series of programs.
