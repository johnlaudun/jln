I've seen a number of almost/somewhat generic researcher positions that I think humanities majors with some computational abilities could not only manage but make a real difference. The convergence of quantitative and qualitative approaches not only to the research which is often the focus of these jobs but also the ability to communicate that research and to adapt to changing circumstances is something we could be really developing in university programs.

Here's one such position with the details of the particular organization removed, but I have seen so many positions like this that this almost feels like a template that's been adapted:
