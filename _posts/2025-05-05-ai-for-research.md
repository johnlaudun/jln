Now that the spring semester is wrapping up, as well as the cold that hammered me in the last half of the last week of classes, I am turning my attention to the many, many, many uses of AI. I have not explored this space for a while, and while I knew that that there had been an explosion in the commercial space, I was not aware of the growth of the space of AI in support of research. 

I am currently reviewing: 

* [Sapien by AcademicID](https://academicid.io/sapien#) whose chief claim rests upon “Messages \[being\] backed by actual research, significantly reducing the risk of hallucination.”
* [SciSpace](https://scispace.com/) seems more focused on an interactive query structure where the AI asks you to narrow your focus more. 
* Finally, there is [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) which has already been discussed quite a bit, but I am only just now catching up to that discussion.
