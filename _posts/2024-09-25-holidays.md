With a number of Jewish holidays coming up, I thought it would be useful to look up other holidays which might also affect students ability to work. (In some cases they may be prohibited from working, and in others it may simply be that working is difficult.)

| Holiday       | Date           |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Rosh Hashanah | Oct 2-4        |
| Yom Kippur    | Oct 11-12      |
| Sukkot        | Oct 16-23      |
| Christmas     | Dec 25         |
| Chanukah      | Dec 25-Jan 2   |
| Ramadan       | Feb 28-Mar 30  |
| Mardi Gras    | Mar 4          |
| Lent          | Mar 5 - Apr 17 |
| Eid al-Fitr   | Mar 30         |
