In a [recent article](https://www.inc.com/maria-haggerty/employees-with-this-1-quality-are-high-performers-heres-why.html) in _Inc_, Maria Haggerty concludes that the single most important quality to look for in individuals who may be, or are, high performers are:

* **long-term commitment to a specific domain**: This describes a person who is committed to making an increasing difference to one domain over a sustained period of time.
* **questing disposition**: When confronted with a challenge, this person becomes excited and wants to pursue that challenge, seeing it as an opportunity to reach the next level of performance.
* **connecting disposition**: A person whose instinct, when confronted with a challenge, is to actively reach out and connect with others who can help address it together.

I look at that list and think: that sounds like you are describing a researcher, or at least a research mindset.
