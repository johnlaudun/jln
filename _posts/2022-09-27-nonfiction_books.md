title: Nonfiction Books I Wish I Still Had

A list of books I loaned out years ago, and apparently never got back, reminded me of some beloved non-fiction books that I am considering re-purchasing:

Trevor Corson’s _Secret Life of Lobsters: How Fishermen and Scientists Are Unraveling the Mysteries of Our Favorite Crustacean_

Hayden Carruth’s _Sitting in: Selected Writings on Jazz, Blues, and Related Topics_

And one book listed as simply as _Stonework_, and while I remember the small paperback well, I do not remember more. Perhaps it is Charles McRaven’s _Stonework: Techniques and Projects_.
