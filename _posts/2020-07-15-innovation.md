In [Why Corporate America Gave Up on R&D](https://marker.medium.com/why-corporate-america-gave-up-on-r-d-43238193c29b), Kaushik Viswanath interviews two of the authors on [“The Changing Structure of American Innovation: Some Cautionary Remarks for Economic Growth”](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25893). They argue that during what might be called the American moment, businesses included research as part of their operations, but that now research has been farmed out to startups and universities. That works for some areas of research but not for those areas requiring multi-disciplinarily solutions.
