[Scholarly XML][] is an extension for Visual Studio Code with a validator and autocomplete for features typically needed by academic encoding projects. It checks if XML is well-formed, validates a file when you open or modify it, makes schema aware suggestions for elements, attributes, and attribute values, shows documentation from schema for elements, attributes, and attribute values when available, and wraps selected text with tags using Ctrl+e. Most importantly, it does not require Java!
