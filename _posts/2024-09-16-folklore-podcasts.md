Someone recently asked about folklore podcasts. Following my folkloristic ideals, as well as allowing for the fact that I can only carry so many podcasts on my listening list, I outsourced the problem to fellow folklorists. (Some may assume that this was a function of laziness, but I can assure you that, yawn, what was the question?)

Here is the list the emerged:

- [Digital Folklore](https://digitalfolklore.fm/) focuses on how thinking about digital culture through the lens of folklore studies forces us to expand the scope of both, culture and its study. It’s presented in a narrative format which can get a bit wild at times. 
- [Folkwise](https://wisefolk.org/folkwise/) shares the importance of folklore by drawing attention to the folklore happening around us every day through digital media.
- [The Fairy Tellers](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fairy-tellers/id1479128804) podcast explores what myths, legends, folklore, fables, and fairy tales have to say about cultures then and now.
- [The Appalachian Folklore Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-appalachian-folklore-podcast/id1644746793) describes itself a “wild hike through the history and migration of the folk culture, stories, traditions, and haints hidden in hills and hollers of Appalachia.”
- It looks like RadioLab did a [12-part series on Dolly Parton](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dolly-partons-america/id1481398762) that one person said was worth a listen.
- [Morbid Curiosity](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-morbid-curiosity-podcast/id1139815028), a history program, got high marks from one of the respondents. It describes itself as being about everything from serial killers to ghosts, ancient remains, and obscure medical conditions.

If you know of other podcasts that should be listed here, please let me know so I can update it.
