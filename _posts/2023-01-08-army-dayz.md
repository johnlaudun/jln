At some point I knew I needed to account for the two years I spent working for / in / with the Army. [Army Dayz](https://johnlaudun.medium.com/army-dayz-9cd47db5ad84) offers a chronology with some reflection. I also have notes on topical / intellectual matters that are, I hope, worth thinking about.
