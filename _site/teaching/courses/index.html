<h1 id="courses">Courses</h1>

<p>These are the courses in which I am currently involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="115/index.md">English 115</a>: Honors Academic Writing</li>
  <li><a href="332/index.md">English 332</a>: Introduction to Folk Narrative</li>
  <li><a href="334/index.md">English 334</a>: Digital Storytelling
<!-- * [English 335](courses/335/index.md): Louisiana Folklore --></li>
  <li><a href="432/index.md">English 432</a>: America in Legend Online and Off</li>
  <li><a href="531/index.md">English 531</a>: Seminar in Narrative Studies</li>
  <li><a href="632/index.md">English 632</a>: Proseminar in Folklore Theory</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are courses I am in the process of designing and imagine teaching in a context where both close and distant reading, where both computation and cogitation, feature equally in the treatment of texts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="c200/index.md">Introduction to Text Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="c300/index.md">What We Think When We Think about Machine Thinking</a></li>
  <li><a href="c400/index.md">The Spread of (Mis)Information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While I have never taught these courses as they are sketched out here, they are based on units or features of courses or workshops I have conducted.</p>
