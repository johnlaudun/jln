<ul>
  <li>Parts of <em>folk speech</em> are covered by the linguistic concept of register. The latter is typically defined as a repertoire of lexemes, prosody, and collocations associated with a particular social practice and with individuals engaged in such practices. The repertoire is possessed by individuals within a group. The register, or repertoire, is variously distributed across the group and thus is also dynamic in nature.</li>
  <li>Typically, use of a register cues participants to the fact that a social practice is occurring: sometimes use of the register constitutes the practice itself. (See: J.L. Austin’s <em>How to Do Things with Words</em> and the idea of perlocutionary.)</li>
  <li>There is a relationship between <em>register</em> as an analytical concept and <em>voice</em>. Voice is simply the linguistic contruction of social persona. Both register, which can be seen as the linguistic construction of a group, and voice depend upon word, word combination, and syntax choices.</li>
  <li>For folklorists, the simplest level of verbal folklore is the traditional word, expression, usage, or name that circulates within a group.</li>
  <li>There is a difference between register and <em>dialect</em>, but that’s for another time.</li>
</ul>
