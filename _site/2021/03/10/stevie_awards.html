<p>The <a href="https://blog.stevieawards.com/2021-stevie-awards-webinars">Stevie Awards</a> are, according to their website, “the world’s premier business awards … created in 2002 to honor and generate public recognition of the achievements and positive contributions of organizations and working professionals worldwide.” I learned about them through a LinkedIn post about their storytelling webinar, which bills itself as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every business has a story, but effective business storytelling is a lot harder than it seems. Corporate storytelling has become the go-to approach for every marketer to get their brand noticed, and moreover, valued by current and potential customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course I am curious, but I also wonder where the boundary for an interest in narrative lies? There’s a good research project, perhaps a dissertation, lying there for someone to pursue: all the ways the business world uses <em>stories</em>, <em>storytelling</em>, and <em>narrative</em>. I once did a survey of how <em>culture</em> is used in the business literature, but that was a while ago.</p>
