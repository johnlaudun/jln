### Treasure in America

Hurley, Gerard T. 1951. Buried Treasure Tales in America. _Western Folklore_ 10/3: 197-216. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1496333).

> This essay from Hurley represents folklore scholarship from the late forties. Be aware that there is some outdated language here. The essay itself is only 8 pages long. The rest of the entry is 102 summaries of treasure tales. 

Mullen, Patrick B. 1978. The Folk Idea of Unlimited Good in American Buried Treasure Legends. _Journal of the Folklore Institute_ 15/3: 209-220. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3813976).

> Mullen introduces us to the notion of a "folk idea", something we will explore in the weeks ahead.

Laudun, John. 2013. Locating Louisiana Legends at the Intersection(s) of Land and Water. International Society for Contemporary Legend Research (Lexington, KY).

> This is the one time that I will, as a professor, make you read my own writing. I am doing so both because our topic is treasure legends and the paper offered here is on Louisiana treasure legends but also because as something written early in the stages of a research project it has plenty of flaws and gaps. 

> See the course main page for the essay as well as the accompanying handout.
