# Memes

Our primary text for this unit is Limor Shifman's _Memes in Digital Culture_, the entirety of which is available as a PDF download from JSTOR: see DOI below. If you want a local copy of the PDF, you will need to download it, which requires registering with EBSCO, which is not difficult but it does add a step, so work ahead of schedule.
