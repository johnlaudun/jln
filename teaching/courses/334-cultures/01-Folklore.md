# What is folklore?

## 1.1 The Meming of Things

There are a lot of ways to begin an exploration of folklore, especially digital folklore, and Lynne McNeill offers us one way to begin thinking about it. While her talk is titled [Folklore doesn't meme what you think it memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBDJ2UJpKt4), she addresses the larger questions of *what is culture?* and *how do we know who we are?* along the way.

## 1.2 Some Terms

There are some terms you are going to encounter repeatedly whenever we read or watch something produced by a folklorist: *performance* and/or *cultural performance*, *text*, *context*, *genre*, *tradition*, and occasionally *competence*. These terms are bound together. Understanding the relationships among the parts lets you focus on those aspects of what is essentially the "engine of culture" that interest you most.
