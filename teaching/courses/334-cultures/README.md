# Digital Folklore & Culture

**Welcome!** Depending upon how you arrived, you are either on the frontispiece/home page for _Digital Folklore and Culture_ or you are looking at the `readme` in the GitHub repository. If you are on the home page, and you can look at [the repo](https://github.com/johnlaudun/digital-folklore) if you like. If you are in the repo, and you really wish you could see this as a formatted document: there's the [GitHub pages URL](https://johnlaudun.github.io/digital-folklore/) and then there's the domain, [DigitalFolklore.net](https://digitalfolklore.net).

## Navigation

If you are ready to begin, take a look at the lefthand column, which is the table of contents for the course. Clicking on a numbered heading — we can call them chapters, if you like (I’m kinda thinking of them that way for the time being) — will take you to a page. When you do that, you will notice that the heading now has subheadings underneath it, and some of those subheadings have a plus sign, `+`, next to them, indicating that there are further organizational divisions within them. All of the sections and subsections are on the single page and you can scroll to them or you can click on the headings and go instantly to that place on the page. 

Because everything is on one page in this setup, embedded media will be used sparingly, so follow the links to watch videos, read PDFs, or engage in an activity. When you are done, you can simply use your browser’s back button, or, if you are a bit more sophisticated, hold down the OPTION or ALT key when clicking a link to open  in a separate tab in your browser. You can then close the tab when you are done watching, reading, or doing and still have the course's page in front of you, taking you to the next viewing, reading, or activity.

## About This Site

This dedicated site was built to make it easier to read as well as to decrease the likelihood of outages -- these pages are served by GitHub which is backed by Microsoft. Outages here are a rare thing. That noted, there is no guarantee that things will not go desperately wrong at precisely the wrong moment, so be sure to work as far in advance as possible.

This site is created using the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) Python documentation library and served through the generosity, and ease of use of [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you visit the site’s [repository](https://github.com/johnlaudun/digital-folklore), you will note that the site is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a plain text markup language that makes it easier to focus on writing, and easier to move your documents around without fear of things going wildly, wildly wrong. 

Finally, it should be noted that this site is very much a work in progress, so do not be surprised to see headings appear, or change, as the semester unfolds.
