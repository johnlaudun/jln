# Seminar in Narrative Studies

ENGL 531-001 / Tuesdays 15:30–18:201800-2050 / HLG 321 / [Schedule](schedule.md)
## Instructor

[Pr. John Laudun](https://johnlaudun.net/) / HLG 356 / TuTh 14:00–18:20 & by appt

## Course Description

Stories feature prominently in our lives and in discourses about our lives. Children ask parents to tell them a story; we swap stories as adults in order to get to know each other; and, increasingly, doctors and lawyers describe the work they do in terms of stories. This seminar is designed to familiarize participants with the wide range of scholarship and science that treats stories. Our goal will be to refine our own working definition of narrative both to understand its nature but also, for those interested in creative projects, to refine our practice. It should be clear from this description that this seminar is open to a wide range of interests: creative, literary, folkloristic, rhetorical, and linguistic.

## Course Objective

The objective of this seminar is to survey the breadth and depth of definitions of narrative both in scholarship and science but also in the larger world. A lot of fields use narrative either as an object of study or as part of their practice. Understanding the implications for both formal and working definitions, for sometimes the definitions are implicit in practice, is central to the work of the seminar. Given the variety of backgrounds of seminar participants, and the range of materials and experiences each will bring to the seminar, the principal goal of the seminar is for each participant to be able to frame their own ongoing *projet* within the larger context of narrative studies. That is, no one can know everything about a field as large and diverse as narrative studies, but you can create for yourself a map of reasonable fidelity such that should you encounter others interested in the study of narrative *qua* narrative, you can expect to move quickly from situating yourselves within the larger domain to a productive dialogue on those matters that interest you.

## Course Texts

Three texts, one classical and two synthetic, are listed below. Much or our reading will be by PDF, either of classical texts available through our LMS or classical and contemporary texts available via one of the online databases or journals. My sincere advice is that you can, wherever possible, print the PDFs and read the articles on paper. Make notes. Scribble angry responses. Doodle when bored. Highlight in a wide variety of colors. 

### Required

Keen, Suzanne. 2003. *Narrative Form*. Palgrave.

Propp, Vladimir. 1968. _Morphology of the Folktale_. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. 

### Recommended/Optional

Herman, David. 2009. _Basic Elements of Narrative_. Wiley-Blackwell. 

In addition to these texts, we will be reading a great deal from materials drawn from sources like JSTOR and Project Muse as well as other materials found online -- either posted to arXiv or to personal, professional, or institutional sites. 

## Course Requirements

The weighting of grades will be as follows: *participation* in the seminar, which includes short in-seminar presentations and activities, makes up one half of a participant's evaluation. The *seminar paper process* makes up the other half. (I stress the importance of process.)

### Participation

Seminar participants are expected to comport themselves as, well, as if they were in a seminar:

> A seminar is, generally, a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate actively. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted. (Thank you, Wikipedia.)

Participation includes a wide variety of forms: active listening, thoughtful speaking, short presentations, involvement in in-class and out-of-class individual and group assignments. Some of these may include, as seems fitting for a seminar led by a folklorist, the occasional exploration of the world beyond campus in the form of observations you make in places like book stores, coffee shops, and other places where people gather to talk or read/write. There is no set list of assignments in this regard: this is something that must arise out of a sense of the seminar as a particular historical group of individuals. (Again, you would expect no less from a folklorist.)

### Seminar Paper

In addition to the assumed active participation, which includes a number of projects and/or assignments as well as active listening and talking, this seminar also requires the preparation of a seminar paper ( >= 5000 words). We will step through the writing process with a series of deadlines for a research proposal, an annotated bibliography, and a series of body paragraphs. The idea behind this particular arrangement is that any project, like an essay, but also known as a *daunting task*, can be broken into smaller steps. Each of these steps can have its own deadline, and each is something you have done before, though perhaps informally, but each of them makes it possible to eat the proverbial elephant, writing one bite at a time. In the academy, productivity is everything, and establishing the mechanics of productivity is helpful. The idea is also to make it possible to explore the viability of a project a little at a time, so that should something not pan out -- you hit a brick wall or you lose interest -- there is still time to change course and pursue something else. The schedule is designed to give participants a series of deadlines that makes it possible to test the viability of an idea and to have time to expand nascent ideas into something of consequence that we call the seminar paper and we often imagine as leading to an article. That is, all the written assignments in this seminar are designed to match conventional scholarly outputs. (See the project description below for more information.)

For most participants, writing a seminar paper in a course focused on intellectual history is fairly difficult: usually the moment of person synthesis, that _ah-hah!_ moment, comes in the latter half of the term. That is not terrible timing for a seminar paper, but for attempting anything earlier, it does make things difficult. Based on past experience, I would like to propose that you begin with a **research proposal** with the following contents:

* a **one-paragraph (200-500 words) statement** of the texts in which you are interested and the theories or models through which you would like to explore them. This is only a preliminary sketch, nothing more. You are putting words down because getting words down is, first, always a good thing, and words beget words, also a good thing. If you'd like to break this into more paragraphs, feel free.
* an **annotated bibliography**, again preliminary/draft in nature, which is divided into two parts: the texts which you wish to examine and the texts which will serve as your analytical and/or theoretical paradigms and/or models. The more you annotate each of these, the better -- you need to get used to, and good at, explaining yourself to interested but non-expert others. Write like you are talking to a class of undergraduates, interested undergraduates.

Single-spaced and citations in whatever formatting your prefer, but used consistently. (For the record, folklore studies uses Chicago B, which makes far more sense than MLA and has not changed in decades.)

### Communications

If you must miss a class meeting, please make sure to contact someone from the course to verify what happened and where we are in the schedule. (If Teams is working, you may feel free to post there. Conversely, if you are checking Teams and you see someone has asked about something in class, please answer their question.)

### Corpus (an option)

*Hold for now*: 

In addition to (or over and against) scholarly/scientific considerations of narrative, the seminar will develop its own _corpus_ of texts which we will use as a place to apply theories and models, as a vehicle for furthering/deepening our discussion about various theories and models, and as a well from which we can draw our own ideas. For more on the corpus, [see below](#corpus).

Because time is not infinite, each of you is constrained by a limit of 10,000 words: this can be one text or several. A further constraint is that we will need to balance our text between those items that are obviously or conventionally narrative and those which test boundaries.

My somewhat informed guess is that many of you already have possible sources, which could range as wildly from the tried and true of [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) or [An Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org) to sites and sources which I cannot imagine. Just in case, here are some lists drawn from rambling around the "intarwebs" that might help you when you get stuck:

- _Open Culture_ lists [800 Free eBooks for iPad, Kindle & Other Devices](http://www.openculture.com/free_ebooks). (_Open Culture_ regularly compiles such lists, so it's worth searching for topics or titles that interest you to see what they may have already compiled in a "listicle" -- [Katherine Kinnaird](http://katherinemkinnaird.net) and I got started on our work on TED talks thanks to an _OC_ article about a list of the talks.)
- _NothingintheRuleBook_ has [55 places you can download tens of thousands books, plays and other literary texts completely legally for free](https://nothingintherulebook.com/2017/01/10/55-places-you-can-download-tens-of-thousands-books-plays-and-other-literary-texts-completely-legally-for-free/).

## Communications

As participants in a seminar, each of you is more a part of overall work than in other courses. Consider yourself co-facilitators, or at least peers: we are here to develop our own thinking but to do so alongside others doing the same. Often, it's somebody else's moment of synthesis that prompts your own or directs you to a new, different line of questioning. The use of an application like Teams is meant to provide us a venue to continue conversations and to encourage everyone to think of this as "us" and not "me and the teacher." (Plus, I don't know about you, but my email inbox feels like a dumpster fire that I just can't seem to put out, so staying out of it is good for everyone.) 

Using a group chat application -- okay, Teams is more than that -- also means that if you miss something, you can poll the group to catch you up. Or to follow up on a reference someone made in a discussion but you didn't quite catch. And I encourage you to make as many of these kinds of interactions "whole group" as you are comfortable doing. Almost always, someone else has the same question or confusion and you may be the person who gives voice to their concern. You too can be a discursive hero.

## Agenda

Our own interests, expertise, and discoveries will determine more clearly how we will actually spend our time. For those reasons, I prefer to establish an agenda for a course, with the proviso that how much we dwell on a topic or gloss it will affect the timing of matters. Thanks to the Mardi Gras holiday, our semester is broken neatly into two blocks of six weeks, with a final seminar held for participant presentations and discussion.

### 1. A Very Bayesian Beginning (J25)

*Narrative* and *story* get used a lot. For our first meeting, after we review the syllabus and introduce ourselves, we will discuss examples of the two that you bring in from out in the world. Each participant should bring in at least one quotation. To make it easier to share, please copy and paste them into a document that you can then print out and bring sufficient copies for all to have one. We will then sort the quotations/usages into groups of our own devising, based on similarities in emergent traits. Try to vary the nature of the examples: make at least one scholarly and/or formal; make one from a popular source -- and not everyone can use Wikipedia! We will discuss the review of Brooks’ _Seduced by Story_  (see Teams for a PDF version) and various videos in this seminar. (Maya Eilam created an [infographic](https://tenderhuman.com/shapes-of-stories-infographic) of Vonnegut’s shapes.)

### 2. The Shape of Stories (J28)

In European tradition prior to the twentieth century, there are really two accounts of *dramatic structure* or shape that were most prominent. The first is Aristotle’s notion of beginning, middle, and end that the plot of all tragedies must possess — note the qualification (which often gets overlooked)—put forth in his *Poetics* (335BCE): 

> A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end. A beginning is that which is not a necessary consequent of anything else but after which something else exists or happens as a natural result. An end on the contrary is that which is inevitably or, as a rule, the natural result of something else but from which nothing else follows; a middle follows something else and something follows from it. Well constructed plots must not therefore begin and end at random, but must embody the formulae we have stated.

Read: at least the first 6 pages of Aristotle’s *Poetics*, available as the translation above on [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1447a). (The quotation is from 1450a.)

The next consideration that “shapes” our current thinking doesn’t occur until the end of the nineteenth century, when the German playwright Gustav Freytag argued in *Die Technik des Dramas* that dramatic structures occurred in five parts: introduction, rise, climax, return or fall, denouement or resolution (or catastrophe). While Freytag’s name is most associated with the shape of dramatic structures, it’s really Selden Lincoln Whitcomb’s _The Study of a Novel_ (1905) whose shape we reference, with its triangular shape shifted noticeably to the right, mapping the length of the narrative to the base of triangle, and thus the climax of a narrative “further” into the telling. As the twentieth century developed, the notion of dramatic shape continued to gain adherents: see, for example, Percy Lubbock’s *The Craft of Fiction* (1921), and as a number of media industries developed, with an especial focus on “middle brow” works, the notion of a formula for crafting a successful novel or film became a part of the industrial landscape. (Painful to think of novels as part of an industry for some, but there you have it.)

The most famous version of this mid-century formula is, of course, the Hollywood formula, which, as [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHollywoodFormula) notes, “follows three characters through three acts.” For a 15-minute version of the formula, listen to [Lou Anders’ explanation](https://writingexcuses.com/2011/10/02/writing-excuses-6-18-hollywood-formula/) on Writing Excuses from 2011. If there is no official handbook for the Hollywood formula, then it can also be glimpsed through all the ways that various artists, critics, and scholars seek to subvert or critique it. See, for example, Dancyger and Rush’s _Alternative Scriptwriting: Beyond the Hollywood Formula_ (2013) or the derision of the formula in Duncan Cooper’s “Who killed *Spartacus*?”

Cooper, Duncan. 1991. WHO KILLED SPARTACUS? *Cinéaste*, *18*(3): 18–27. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41687089. 

There are a lot more shapes to consider: [Reedsy outlines 7](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/) in a 2018 post, but we will wrap up our consideration of such structures/shapes with the story circle, which most writers attribute to Dan Harmon, who suggests that it became more clear to him while working on _Community_. (I will leave it to your independent investigatory impulses to explore the connections between Harmon’s *story circle* and Joseph Campbell’s *hero’s journey*.)

We will start our discussion with texts like Conrad’s _[Heart of Darkness](https://loristics.net/texts/hod.html)_ (1899), Connell’s [“The Most Dangerous Game”](https://loristics.net/texts/mdg.html) (1924), _Casablanca_ (1942), _Star Wars: A New Hope_ (1977) — because Lucas helped revive Campbell), and _Die Hard_ (1988), but feel free to bring examples of your own: there are pyramids and circles (and beats and whatever else) everywhere you turn.

### 3 & 4. Narrative Form (F4 & 11)

Having tacked somewhat randomly through the great Sea of Narratology, and given ourselves time for books to come in, it is time to set a clearer course. Suzanne Keen’s *Narrative Form* is our guide for two seminars. For the first meeting, we will discuss major approaches and theorists, shapes, situation, and characters (Chapters 1-4). In our second seminar on *Narrative Form*, we will take up plot, timing, order, levels, worlds, and genres. If that list leaves you breathless, then you have some sense of the whirlwind nature of her tour (and some sense of just how much water there is in this sea). Words to work by: start reading as soon as you can and tackle one chapter in a sitting, and only one chapter. Digest the chapter’s contents before moving onto the next.

### 5. Early Structuralism: Formalist Syntagms

Perhaps only lagging behind Claude Levi-Strauss’ “The Structural Study of Myth” as one of the most renown works of folk narrative study, Propp’s _Morphology_ shaped much of the classical work in mythology to come later in the twentieth century and would, in fact, have a significant influence on early attempts to build computational models of narrative in the early twenty-first century. (More on this in the redux of the shape of stories later in the semester.)

Read: Propp, Vladimir. 1968. _Morphology of the Folktale_. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. 

### 6. Early Structuralism: Paradigms

Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1955. The Structural Study of Myth. *Journal of American Folklore* 68 (270): 428-44. 

Lévi-Strauss’ approach was never operationalized, per se, but was rather adapted in various ways by European and American scholars. Combined with Jacques Lacan’s efforts at psychological structuralism and with the revolution in generative linguistics started by Noam Chomsky, textual structuralisms took on a variety of forms, some of which we will glimpse after the break. 

Meanwhile, as they say, there was this ongoing method of breaking stories into plot points and then cataloguing the resulting structures into types. In this meeting, we familiarize ourselves with one way the idea of functions in folktales were operationalized, *The Tale-Type Index* and, later, its companion set of volumes, *The Motif Index*. With the readings in mind, we settle down to using the volumes to classify a number of tales. 

*There are no class meetings during Mardi Gras break. Enjoy!*

## Resources

_The lists below are by no means comprehensive, only suggestive. If you find something that should be added here, please let me know._

### Journals

Please note that the hyperlinks for JSTOR and Project Muse take you directly to the journal's main page and not the home page of those two services.

The _Journal of Narrative Theory_ appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the _Journal of Narrative Technique_, JNT "has provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives." JNT is available on-line through Project Muse.

_Narrative_ is "the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative's broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art." The Society's website is: <http://narrative.georgetown.edu/>. Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR.

_Storyworlds_ is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations." Current journal contents and contact information are available at <http://storyworlds.osu.edu>. The journal is available on-line on Project Muse.

In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as _Discourse Processes_ or _Genre_.

### Special Issues

In Autumn 1980, _Critical Inquiry_ 7(1) released a special issue entitled simply: On Narrative. (URL: <http://www.jstor.org/stable/i257724>.) The table of contents reads like a who's who of scholars from the era:

### Before Our Beginning

As noted elsewhere, prior to the twentieth century, interested commentators were more focused on narrative's manifestations in various forms of discourse, as is the case with Aristotle's concern with the nature of tragedy in the plays of his day. Aristotle's _Poetics_ are available in a number of locations: [Project Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0056) has an authoritative edition of Aristotle's Poetics which is generously annotated but requires you to be online and [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763) has a variety of formats which can easily be downloaded for offline viewing.
